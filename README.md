# HTML FORM

This project demonstrates the example of using html form to make a survey of smokers. In the making of html form there things to consider

### Wrap form using tag \<form>
The tag form works for each form individually, you are not to make it nested, just make another form in the same pair if you have multiple forms in the same page

### Give label for each input
Label works as identity for each input, and will refer to the same id of input
